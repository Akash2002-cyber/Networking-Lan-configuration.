Single with One Router
----------------------

First take the router, switch and PC's required to install the single lane.

{ I have to take a 25 Computers, 1 (2960-24 TT) Switch , 1 (ISR 4331) Router, and 1 DHCP Server.
Why can I choose DHCP server , because I take more computers and IP allocation was very difficult and take more time }

Then connect each computer to the switch
{ each computers and switch can be connected through COPPER STRAIGHT THROUGH cables.}  

Then connect the switch and the router.

Now connected all types of devices and then choose the IP address for each computer and configure it.
{I will take a C class IP Address.}
{Computer IP Configuration
 
    #Go to Desktop
    #Click IP configuration
    #Enter IP address, Subnet mask, Default Gateway
    #And click close option }


The next step is to configure the router.

{Router Configuration Comments

   #enable
   #config terminal
   #interface gig 0/0/0
   #ip address (ip Address)(subnet mask)
   #no shutdown
   #exit 
}


Now that we can Build a LAN of a small size.
